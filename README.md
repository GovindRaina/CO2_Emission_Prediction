# CO2_Emission_Prediction

CO2 Emissions Analysis and Prediction
Welcome to the CO2 Emissions Analysis and Prediction project repository!

Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict CO2 emissions based on vehicle characteristics. A web application has been developed using Python and Streamlit framework to provide an interactive platform for users to explore CO2 emissions trends and predict emissions for vehicles based on their specifications.

Key Features
Data preprocessing: Cleaning and processing of the dataset to enhance accuracy.
Visualization: Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore CO2 emissions trends across various vehicle attributes.
Predictive Modeling: Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor model using Scikit-learn to predict CO2 emissions.
User Interface: Streamlit web application providing user-friendly input fields for predicting CO2 emissions based on vehicle specifications.
Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit
